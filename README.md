# React-redux-todo-starter-project
## Contains the following:
* React
* Redux/React-Redux
* React Router (`react-router-dom`)
* Redux Form
* Redux Promise Middleware (A lightweight alternative to redux-thunk)
* Redux Logger (A great logger tool to keep track of actions fired and updated state)


To get started:
```
git clone https://github.com/johnazre/react-redux-todo-starter.git
cd react-redux-todo-starter
npm install
npm start
```

There is one test currently failing in the App component, which should have been fixed by exporting the App component separately from the "connected" exported component. If you can fix that, send a PR.
